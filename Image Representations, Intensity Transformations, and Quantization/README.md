# Image Representations, Intensity Transformations & Quantization
## Overview
The project was built with Python and mainly uses numpy.
Developed as a part of Image Processing course at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Subjects covered:
- Reading and displaying images
- Transformations vetween RGB and YIQ color spaces
- Histogram Equations
- Image Quantization
